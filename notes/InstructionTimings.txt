Integer unit instruction latencies

   add/sub/logical
 	- 1 cycle.

   mul
	- 2 cycles

   divide
	- 30 cycles

   save/restore
        - 3 cycles (introduces a 3-cycle bubble)


   Read-after-write stall (I+1 <- I) = latency.
   Read-after-write stall (I+2 <- I) = max (0, latency - 1).



Floating point unit instruction latencies

   all operations except divide and sqrt take 3 cycles.

    divide latency = 30 (single precision), 50 (double precision)
    sqrt latency   = 30


   Read-after-write stall (I+1 <- I) = latency.
   Read-after-write stall (I+2 <- I) = max (0, latency - 1).


Load/Store

	load/store latency for cache hit = 2 cycles
		(L1 Dcache 32kB, 64-byte line size, direct-mapped,
			write-though-allocate)
		(L1 Icache 64-byte line size, direct mapped)
		(MMU!)
